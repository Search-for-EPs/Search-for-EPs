### Documentation

Using docs here can help you not only document your code but also keep notes about 
what you're trying and why.
The docs here use something called restructured text or rst files. 
It is a type of markdown but a little more complex.

To build the docs, perform the following:

```bash
cd docs
make html
cd build/html
firefox index.html
```
