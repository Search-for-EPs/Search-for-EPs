Code
====

This section gives a brief overview of the code in this package. All classes and functions in each file are listed and
explained below. As already mentioned in the User Guide this package was part of a master thesis, which is why most
functions and classes are suited to the problem in this master thesis and to the other programs used during this thesis.
Nevertheless some of the functions can be used for other problems as well.
